## Task

### Requirements

There are intentionally rough requirements - We would really like you to think about what functionality, interaction and design details you would want to build into a webapp like this, and show us.

1. the game is single-player and runs on one browser client, multiple players can be supported by playing a hot-seat game (taking turns in the same web app)

2. the web app should use a set of random images for memory cards fetched from [CAT API](https://developers.thecatapi.com/view-account/ylX4blBYT9FaoVd6OhvR?report=bOoHBz-8t)

   • registration and API key not needed (the service works free as well)

   • if you're not into cats that much, you can use any service you like, but it needs to be an online service with a REST api

3. the game presents the cards in a rectangular layout, where the memory game can be played according to [classic memory game rules](https://www.classicgamesandpuzzles.com/Memory.html)

4. the app tracks the current and end result somehow

### Guidance

You can use the web application framework and design elements of your choice, we encourage using the ones you're the most comfortable and familiar with, also recommend you to implement it as a single page application.

We would encourage you to focus on areas and details that are important to you. There is no one correct solution to this challenge, and we have seen a great many answers to this. There are a few aspects you might want to consider, for example:

• what kind of states the app should have?

• even if not everything is polished (which is ok), where to put in some more details or visual polish?
